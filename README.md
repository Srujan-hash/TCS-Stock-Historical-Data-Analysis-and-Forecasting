<h1>üöÄ TCS Stock Historical Data Analysis and Forecasting

<h3>This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis and technical deep dive into nearly two decades of historical stock data for 

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Using Python's data science stack, we aim to understand the stock's long-term behavior, quantify its risk, and establish a 

baseline forecast for future price movements.


<h2>üéØ Key Analysis Objectives:

<h3>The project leveraged historical data spanning from August 2002 to September 2021  to achieve the following:


Behaviour Analysis: Determine the strong long-term price trend (bullish) and characterize the stock's volatility/risk profile.





Trend Identification: Analyze trading volume to assess rising market liquidity and investor interest over time.





Forecasting: Apply a quantitative model (Linear Regression) to predict short-term future price movement as a preliminary forecast.



<h2>üìä Key Findings & Insights:

<h3>The analysis confirms TCS as a 

strong long-term growth stock:


Bullish Trend Confirmed: The stock shows a strong and consistent bullish (upward) trend over the two decades, technically confirmed by the 50-day SMA consistently trading above the 200-day SMA.




<h2>üìà Rising Liquidity:

<h3>Trading Volume has increased significantly over the period, suggesting rising market participation and greater liquidity for the stock.



<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate-to-High Risk: 

<h3>The stock exhibits a notable degree of price fluctuation, with an Annualized Volatility of approximately 63.67%. This indicates significant price swings and suggests a 

moderate-to-high risk profile despite the overall growth.


<h2>ü§ñ Forecasting Methodology:

<h3>A simple 

Linear Regression model was applied to capture the persistent, straight-line growth component of the stock price.



Result: The model projected a continuation of the upward trend for the subsequent 60 days.


Limitation: This is a baseline forecast and does not incorporate complex factors like market events, macroeconomic news, or short-term cyclical patterns.


<h2>üíª Technology Stack & Deliverables:

<h3>Data Manipulation & Time-Series: pandas (for index setting, moving average calculation, and datetime handling).

Visualization: matplotlib (for plotting price trends, moving averages, and volume).

Forecasting: scikit-learn (Linear Regression model).
