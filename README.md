# TCS-Stock-Historical-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting
This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis and technical deep dive into nearly two decades of historical stock data for   Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Using Python's data science stack, we aim to understand the stock's long-term behavior, quantify its risk, and establish a   baseline forecast for future price movements.
